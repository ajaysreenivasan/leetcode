PROBLEM:
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

SOLUTION:
 This is a common interview problem.

 The variant I've usually seen involves just one type of bracket, however the solution is largely the same. 

- Observations:
   Given the parameters in the problem statement, we need some way to track which bracket has been opened so far. There's no need to track the closing brackets. 

- Method:
   Use a stack to track open brackets.

   If a closing bracket is seen:
   - error if the open/close pair don't match
   - error if there are no open brackets in the stack
   - pop the matching open bracket off the stack, and continue

   The string is valid if at the end of iterating over the string the stack is empty, and the other error states have not occurred.

- Complexity:
  TIME: O(n) for the scan through the string
        
        Overall: O(n)

  SPACE: O(n) for the stack
